# 🌸 Day 134 Python Mission ❤️

> **180 Days Python Journey**  
> **Updating Data with PUT and PATCH Requests ✏️**

## 🌼 Hello My Sweet Developer,

Welcome to **Day 134**! 🌼

Yesterday, you learned how to send data using a **POST** request.
Today you'll learn how to **update existing data** using **PUT** and **PATCH** requests, two important HTTP methods used in real-world APIs.

# 📚 Today's Topic

## 🔄 Updating Resources with PUT and PATCH

### 🌟 Why are we learning this?

Applications often need to update user profiles, edit orders, or change settings. APIs usually provide **PUT** and **PATCH** methods for these tasks.

- **PUT** replaces an entire resource.
- **PATCH** updates only specific fields.

# 🚀 Today's 10 Python Missions

1. Import the `requests` library.
2. Create a dictionary named `updated_data` with `title`, `body`, and `userId`.
3. Send a **PUT** request to `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1`.
4. Print the HTTP status code returned by the PUT request.
5. Convert the PUT response to Python using `.json()`.
6. Create another dictionary containing only a new `title`.
7. Send a **PATCH** request to the same URL using the new dictionary.
8. Print the HTTP status code for the PATCH request.
9. Display the JSON returned by the PATCH request.
10. **Revision:** Write three differences between **POST**, **PUT**, and **PATCH**.

# 🎉 Python Fun Fact

Many profile editing screens in mobile apps use **PATCH** because only the changed fields are sent to the server, saving bandwidth.

---

# 🔄 Quick Recap

- `requests.put()` replaces an entire resource.
- `requests.patch()` updates selected fields.
- Both methods return responses that can be read with `.json()`.
- Choosing the correct HTTP method makes APIs more efficient.

# 🔮 Tomorrow's Adventure

Tomorrow you'll learn how to delete data using the **DELETE** request and understand when it should be used.

# 💜 A Little Note for My Sweet Developer ❤️

You're now learning the complete set of basic HTTP methods that power modern web applications.

Keep practising, stay curious, and remember that every mission brings you one step closer to becoming a confident Python developer.

With lots of love,

**Your biggest supporter ❤️**
